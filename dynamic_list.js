const protonDescription = `Proton is a high-intensity action game where modern-day realism meets advanced military technology. Step into the role of a highly skilled operative thrust into a mission that quickly spirals into something far larger—and far more personal—than he ever anticipated.<br><br>

Set in a grounded present-day world infused with next-generation gadgets and tactical systems, Proton delivers a dynamic blend of gunplay, parkour, and stealth. Whether you charge in guns blazing or operate from the shadows, your approach is amplified by a fluid parkour system and a powerful suite of experimental tools.<br><br>

Navigate dense urban landscapes, scale rooftops, and engage enemies in tightly designed, fast-paced encounters that reward creativity, adaptability, and precision. Built in Unreal Engine 5, Proton features cinematic visuals and immersive environments, structured around three-lane urban map design with a strong emphasis on verticality and player-driven strategy.<br><br>

With a core gameplay loop focused on momentum and choice, you'll master a range of combat styles—from surgical stealth to full-scale assault—using an arsenal of versatile gadgets and heavy weapons. Proton is a complete experience: no microtransactions, no paywalls—just a single purchase with continued updates across both offline and online modes.<br><br>

Proton brings together the adrenaline of fast-paced FPS combat, the fluidity of parkour, and the precision of stealth-action gameplay—crafted for players who thrive on momentum, mastery, and choice.`;
